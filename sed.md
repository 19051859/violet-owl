In my venture, Financial Risk is the big one. It refers to our ability to maintain its revenue and economy leverage. A business concept which looks perfect on paper may sometime hard to prove in real world.

Being a late follower, we will have to deal with competition and fight against establishers, more experienced businesses in the same industry. There are many financial crisis which are need to focus before facing failure.

1\. **Money and Resources**: Being a great dealer, sometimes lack of money describes your company future face. Managing and maintaining all the record of booking data is very tedious task. It can be more difficult, when the pricing and offer any deals fluctuates, also we need to maintain equilibrium relationship with our sponsors.

2\. **Financial Crisis**: No doubt, customers safety is the first priority in our business. For instances, insurance policy, free upgrade program which not only satisfy the customer but also increase the market value but somehow, maintaining these policies can lead to loose. When the insurance company didn’t receive any benefit or profit. They deny to insurance our car which directly plunge the cost of our business.

3\. **Politics and government Policy**: Changes in in government policy can lead to major effect on our business.

4\. **Keeping your Customers**: For long-term business, we always lower our prices to keep our customer from renting their car cheaper than foreign car which can lower our revenue in business.

5\. **Competing the Cost**: The cost of raw material suddenly increases, not to using flexible assessment engine, a customer doesn’t pay and our company start struggling.

**Market Risk**: My Company is late mover, so we also have more market risk as we need to fix our foot step in the market and wins the confidence of customer satisfaction for the long lasting business.

1\. **Competition from other businesses**: Unless, my company is late in the market we will have to deal with competition. In market, where customers have high faith and loyalty to an existing solution, it’s difficult of getting customers to start thinking about switching. As car rental business is already in the market, we need to gain the customer satisfaction with new strategy.

**Team Risk**: Unless you’re one -person show, even a well-run business may not be able to survive if the employees of my company have same passionate as we are enthusiastic towards our product. Team are having major role in the company to accomplish the specific tasks that is assigned to launch the latest product in the market which will be acceptable by customer and gain their satisfaction. Sometimes, team feel outdated to upgrade the plan of renting a car and they switch their dedication from renting a car business to some other product or internal politics and conflicts can devastate a good company reputation.

**Vehicle Damage**: Car Accident Risk is also the major drawback in your business. No doubt we are having the insurance policy and we firstly check the car health but somehow the consequences doesn’t fulfill the requirement and we lose our business.
